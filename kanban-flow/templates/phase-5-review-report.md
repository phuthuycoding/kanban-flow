# Review Report

## Feature
{feature_name}

## Review Status
- {review_status}

## Delivery

| Field | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ci` | {ci} | `green`: the PR checks passed on the reviewed sha. `red`: a check failed; the report cannot be PASS, write FAIL and return to implementation. `none`: the repository runs no GitHub Actions on the PR (no `.github/workflows`), so no watch ran. |
| `landing` | {landing} | `pr`: the reviewed code lands through the PR recorded with `kf issues link <feature> <url> --pr`. `none`: nothing to land (no tracked code changed), no PR is opened and the item closes without a merge. |

PASS requires `ci` other than `red`, and either `landing: pr` with the PR recorded or `landing: none`.
